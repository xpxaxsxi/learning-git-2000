# learning-git-2000
Learning git and github here. 

  I know I can use git and github to manage all sorts of textual stuff, not just programming stuff. 
  Maybe I will write here some weird stuff and stir up some interest to learning git!
  
  I wish I could have a private project for this really newbie messing around.
